# VBA-Library
## Description
This library contains classes, forms and modules that ease coding in VBA by providing basic functionality that is otherwise more tedious to achieve in VBA.

## Usage
All source files can be found inside the [src](https://github.com/NicklasRatay/VBA-Library/tree/main/src) directory. To use this library the source files simply need to be imported into the VBA-project. This can be done the best by just dragging and dropping all needed files into the project explorer of the Visual Basic Editor. Notice that the source files do not depend on each other so it is no problem to import just the files really needed for the project.

## Help
The technical documentation of this library can be found inside the [doc](https://github.com/NicklasRatay/VBA-Library/tree/main/doc) directory. There is a dedicated markdown file containing method descriptions and short code examples for each source file.
